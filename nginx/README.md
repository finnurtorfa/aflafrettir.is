Nginx configuration
===================

Rename the configuration file:

    mv nginx.conf yourapplication.conf

Make all the necessary adjustments to the configuration file and create a 
symlink to it into nginx's *sites-enabled* directory:

    ln -s yourapplication.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
